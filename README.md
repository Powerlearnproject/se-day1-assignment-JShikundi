#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools in the development and maintenance of sodtware systems. It plays a crucial role by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life across the different sectors including commerce, education, healthcare and entertainment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
> The development of programming languages such as Fortran in 1954, released in 1957 and C language in 1972 which paved the way for modern computing
> The birth of the term 'software engineering' as popularized at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in Germany. It highlighted the need for a more structured and systematic approach
> The introduction of structured programming in the 1970s  which emphasized clear control flow which helped reduce complexity in programs.
> The agile manifesto in 2001 which outlined key values and principles for Agile software development which marked a shift to more iterative and adaptive approaches.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
> Identify the problem and possible solution
> Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and sytem requirements
> Design: Creating detailed designs of software architecture and user interface
> Implementation: Writing the code and building the software according to design specifications
> Testing: To ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements
> Deployment to users
> Maintenance: To provide ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after development.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards while the agile methodology is a more iterative and adaptive approach focused on flexibility and responding to change.
The waterfall methodology is ideal for projects with stable requirements and need for rigorous documentation. It is appropriate in industries like health and finance with strict adherence to documentation and regulation.
The agile  methodology excels in environments where flexibility and rapid feedback are crucial such as in complex and dynamic projects where innovation and experimentation is required.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
> Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
> Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
> Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
> IDEs: Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Examples: VisualStudio, Eclipse, IDEA
> VCS: Software for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples: Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
> Changing requirements during the development cycle leading to project delays
> Tight deadlines which can result in rushed development and compromised quality
> Technical debt from shortcuts which impede future developments and increase maintenance costs
Strategies to overcome the above challenges: Effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and deadlines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
> Unit testing: Testing individual components or modules of software
> Integration testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
> System testing: Testing the entire system as a whole
> Acceptance testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is about crafting questions or statements to get the best possibe responses from AI. It is important in ensuring AI understands exactly what you need by giving clear, specific and concise instructions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about space
Improved prompt: Tell me about planets of the solar system.
The improved prompt is more effective as adding context helps AI understand your request better and subsequently gives you a better, more specific answer.
